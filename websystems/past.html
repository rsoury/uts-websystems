                    I did not start coding seriously until I left high school.

                    <p>
                      It all started in high school when my Dad gave me a <i>"Learn Java is 21 Days"</i> book. From there I learnt
                      how to develop very small programs but never took it seriously.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      In high school we learnt Visual Basic, and when we were tasked with creating a Checkers board game with the
                      language, I was compelled to take it a step further. This is when I understood how creatively liberating
                      programming can be. You can think of a software based concept, and with careful execution, you can make it a reality
                      without any expense or investment.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      When I left school, I really set out to take my programming skills to the next level.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      I created a game called Coin Slap in Java (JFrame), Swift and Android and also a novelty (but pretty dumb) app
                      called Timed Wallpaper in Android. I also began Stock Trading and used Java to develop some software to track
                      multiple websites with Selenium and Java but that didn't work as well as I hoped. I was employed to a business
                      during that year named Pneumatic and Automation Equipment and developed some Selenium based crawlers for them in Java.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Eventually I moved to a web design and development business named Australian Internet Advertising, where I
                      built, maintained and edited Wordpress and PHP websites. It was fairly basic, but it allowed me to progress,
                      my web development skills. I also met a really good programmer there who, before he left, mentioned some things
                      about Node.js and Amazon Elastic Beanstalk. Despite the fact that these two tech stacks don't really do much
                      solely together, it did spark my curiousity to learn what they were and this started a snowball effect which
                      led me to learn about the big wide world of software with all its glorious Git and Mercurial repositories and
                      its nasty debates over whether its better to use Redis or Memcache or if Nginx is better than Apache.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      In the first semester of 2016, I was also in the Software Development Studio and thanks to <a href="https://github.com/nhardy">a very good bloke</a>,
                      a fun team and a good mentor, I learnt the basics of React.js, Redux.js, Flux, etc.
